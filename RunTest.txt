Make Sure you have hardhat installed in your system. If not run "npm install hardhat" command in terminal. 

Split the terminal in two.
Step 1 -> In one terminal Run "npx hardhat node" command to get local blockchain and 20 free accounts with 10000 Test-Ethers with private keys. (alternative Ganache)
Step 2 -> In other terminal Run "npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost" to deploy the Smart Contract on the local network & connect with the blockchain.
Step 3 -> Run "npm run dev" to start the localhost.


*** IMPORTANT ***
Remember to delete artifacts, cache & NFTMarketplace.json file from Context folder every time you close to start the project.
After step 1 & step 2 (after smart contract connects with local blockchain) remember to drag "NFTMarketplace.json" file from 'artifacts/contracts/NFTMarketplace.json' to Context folder.
Then start the localhost
