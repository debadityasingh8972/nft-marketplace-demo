# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
run npm install
open package.json or scripts
run npm step1 
run npm step2 
head to http://localhost:3000
```
